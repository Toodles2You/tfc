About

### This is work-in-progress! Use at your own discretion.

Team Fortress Classic with balance changes & new features.  
This mod is derived from my [Half-Life multiplayer mod base](https://github.com/Toodles2You/halflife-deathmatch).  

Special thanks to [FortressOne](https://www.fortressone.org/), which was referenced for the implementation of the map entities.
